EcoRoute Planner

IU Internationale Hochschule - Project: Software Engineering (DLMCSPSE01).
Student: Manoj Marakala
Task 1 Design and development of a web application.

Project Description
EcoRoute Planner is a new web application that supports environmentally-aware urban commuters (25-40 years) in search of the most sustainable multimodal route (public transport, bicycle, walking, e-scooter) with the help of carbon footprint calculation and comparisons.
Contrary to the current navigation tools, which only optimite based on time or distance, EcoRoute Planner gives preferences to the CO2 reduction and encourages behavioural shifts in the long term(gamification (eco-badges) and monthly sustainability reports).

Core Features (MVP)
Authentication of users and profile.
Origin/destination input Route search.
Carbon footprint on-the-fly calculator (carbon emitted by EU/EPA);
Comparison of the visual paths (charts + low-tech Leaflet map).
Gamification: environmental warranties and developmental dashboard.
CO2-saving report is exportable on monthly basis.

Tech Stack
Frontend: React.js + Vite
Backend: Node.js + Express
Database: MongoDB (Atlas)
Mapping: Leaflet.js and the OpenStreetMap.
Hosting: AWS / Render / Railway (need to be selected after Phase 2)
Version control Version control: Git + GitHub (this repository)

Project Phases (Portfolio)
Phase 1- Conception (current) - done and handed in in PebblePad.
Phase 2 - Development (Reflection)- ongoing.
Phase 3 Finalization and Deployment - intended.

Structure of Repository (will increase during the following weeks)
